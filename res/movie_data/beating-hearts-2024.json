  "overview": "Raised in a troublesome neighbourhood, local rebellious teenager Clotaire falls for his schoolmate Jackie, charmed by her fearless spirit and sharp wit. As powerful first love blossoms between the two, rampant gang violence entices him into a much darker path and ultimately destroys all they have built when he is charged with a crime he didn\u2019t commit. After many years apart, now leading profoundly different lives, the star-crossed lovers discover that every path they\u2019ve taken leads them back together, but will love triumph over Clotaire's quest for revenge?",
