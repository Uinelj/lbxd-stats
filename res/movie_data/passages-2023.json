  "overview": "In contemporary Paris, German filmmaker Tomas embraces his sexuality through a torrid love affair with a young woman named Agathe, an impulse that blurs the lines that define his relationship with his husband, Martin. When Martin begins an extramarital affair of his own, he successfully gains back his husband\u2019s attention while simultaneously unearthing Tomas\u2019 jealousy. Grappling with contradicting emotions, Tomas must either embrace the confines of his marriage or come to terms with the relationship having run its course.",
