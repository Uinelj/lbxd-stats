  "overview": "The story revolves around the life of Mi, a free-spirited young woman in the very conservative 1940's Burmese society, and her many lovers. She drinks. She smokes. She thinks you're a joke.  She's also traumatized, insecure, and very tired in life. She's like a butterfly ... a butterfly pinned to a cardboard.
